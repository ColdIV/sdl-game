# SDL2
This project depends on SDL2 and SDL_image. I did not include the files in here to keep the repository as simple and clean as possible.

# Download
SDL2:       http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

SDL_image:  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

You will have to download the "Development Libraries" and extract them in the same directory as this file is in.
This directory should then have:
- SDL2_image-2.0.5/
- SDL2-2.0.12/
- README.md (The file you are currently reading)
