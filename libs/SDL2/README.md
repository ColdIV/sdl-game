# SDL2
This project depends on SDL2 and SDL_image. I did not include the files in here to keep the repository as simple and clean as possible.

# Source
SDL2:       https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.0.12

SDL_image:  https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image

You will have to download the "Development Libraries" and extract them in the same directory as this file is in.
This directory should then have:
- SDL2_image-2.0.5/
- SDL2-2.0.12/
- README.md (The file you are currently reading)
